Observations: The code given in step one takes an input in from the terminal and used for an input in the function usleep(). The process forks and both processes loop 100 times. Each process states which who they are (parent/child) and the incrementing number used in the for loop (0-99) before waiting (using usleep(n)). For step 4a, the inputs of 500 and 5000 show that there is no way to predict which thread the scheduler is going to call at any given time.

Output for step 3:
[halbrigh@linux10608 coen177]$ gcc lab2-1.c -o Lab2
[halbrigh@linux10608 coen177]$ ./Lab2
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[halbrigh@linux10608 coen177]$ 

Outputs for step 4:

[halbrigh@linux10608 coen177]$ gcc lab2-1.c -o Lab2
[halbrigh@linux10608 coen177]$ ./Lab2 3000
