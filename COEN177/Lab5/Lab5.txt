Step 1 Code Question and Output:
The threadHello program shares the address of i and by the time go function follows that address, the value of i may have changed. The threadSynch program is different from the threadHello program through the parameters inputted to the function "go". In threadHello, the parameter is "&i" but threadSynch inputs "(Void *)(size_t)i" which is a 32 bit number, casted as a 64 bit number, which is then casted as a pointer. When that is casted as an integer in the go function, it is converted to the initial value of i. In addition, the semaphore makes it so that no more than one thread can be in that critical section at a time (the body of the "go" function).
